Unreleased
- Massive internal rewrite:
    - Source code is now purely C++ instead of mixed C/C++
    - Output and text formating now utilize the fmt library, which is safer and typically faster than C stdio implementations
- Easy mode multithreaded now generates scan jobs per-directory instead of per-file, which provides an approximately 15% performance boost due to reduced thread idling time
- Fixed a critical bug inherited from loudgain where the program segfaults when trying to delete tags from M4A or WMA files
- Added -t option which allows users to choose between sample peak and true peak for peak calculations
- Added -O option in Easy Mode which outputs a .csv spreadsheet scan log in every scanned directory 
- Write uppercase tags by default for all tag types in Easy Mode
- Optimized scan progress bar, resulting in signifcant speed boost for Windows single threaded scanning
- Removed options that enabled non-standard behavior:
  - -s e option which wrote non-standard REPLAYGAIN_REFERENCE_LOUDNESS and REPLAYGAIN_*_RANGE tags
  - -s l option which wrote non-standard LU units to *_GAIN tags instead of dB
- Changed how target loudness is specified:
  - Removed -d option which specified a "pre-gain" from -18 LUFS
  - Replaced with -l option which allows the user to specify the target loudness directly in LUFS
- Write ID3v2.3 tags by default in Custom Mode
- Added -m MAX option to use the maximum concurrent threads value provided by the OS
- Changed clipping protection:
  - Now specified with 3 choice character option instead of a boolean
  - Old -k functionality is now -k a
  - New -k p functionality only provides clipping protection for positive gain values, which is now the default in Easy Mode
- Added global target loudness option -l in Easy Mode
- Windows: Added resource file containing VERSIONINFO
- Removed strip tags option (-S)
- Changed default behavior for Opus files:
  - Write standard ReplayGain tags by default instead of RFC 7845 R128_*_GAIN tags
  - Keep default loudness at -18 LUFS
  - Introduce -o option which writes the RFC 7845 for users that need it
